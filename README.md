# Misc
Copies of random files from my VimWiki so they can be accessed on another Machine easy
Mostly condensed versions of Guides, but possibly other things, but who knows

## Why?
Sometimes you are asked to do something that requires prior research / collection of general info, links, tips, etc. This is a place to store all of that info and quickly be able to access these links and such.. So when I'm required to actually `do the thing` I'm not searching on multiple webpages
